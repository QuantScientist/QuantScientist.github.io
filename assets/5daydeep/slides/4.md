# Target Audience and Prerequisites:

### Prereqs & Preparation

- Experience in `Python programming is a must`, basic knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.
- We also assume `BASIC` familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book). Any prior knowledge in Deep Learning is a plus, but an interest is a must!

### Software etc
- Attendees are expected to bring their own laptops for the hands-on practical work.
- A remote GPU by Microsoft will be provided for each participant.
- A deep learning docker image based on Ubuntu Linux 16.04: https://github.com/QuantScientist/Deep-Learning-Boot-Camp/tree/master/docker
