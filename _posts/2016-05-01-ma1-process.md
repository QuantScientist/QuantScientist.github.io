# Abstract:

The new C++11 standard introduced a number of pseudo-random number generators (PRNG'S) designed to replace (or be used in conjunction with) the corresponding generators from the BOOST library. This example simulates a first-order MA(1) process involving a C++11 random number generator, rather than invoking R's internal rand method.
