# Abstract:
To your surprise, you are told that the problem at hand, is exactly the same as the following problem:
A test for grey eyes in unborn foals during pregnancy has probability of .95 of being correct whether or not grey eyes are present.
1% of foal pregnancies result in grey eyes.
  
# Question:  
Calculate the probability of a test indicating that grey-eyes are present.

Further, you are told that if you are able to successfully resolve the problem, your seat in the Data-Science team at Bayes-Video-Tech is guaranteed !!!

So what is the probability ... ? 

# Answer:

We are given that:

| Probability                 |Explanation                                                                                        |  
|:----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|P(A)= 0.01|The probability of greay-eyes                                                                      |
|P(~A)=1-0.01=.99|The probability of no greay-eyes                                                                   |
|P(~B GIVEN ~A)=0.95|The probability that the test will yield a negative result [~B] if greay-eyes are NOT present [~A] |
|P(B GIVEN ~A)=1-0.95=.05	      |The probability that the test will yield a positive result [B] if greay-eyes are NOT present [~A]  |
|P(B GIVEN A)=0.95	              |The probability that the test will yield a positive result [B] if greay-eyes are present [A]       |
|P(~B GIVEN A)=1-0.95=.05  	    |The probability that the test will yield a negative result [~B] if greay-eyes are present [A]      | 

And we are asked to find:
The probability of a test indicating that grey-eyes are present = P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]  = [0.95 * 0.01] + [.05 * .99] = .059
